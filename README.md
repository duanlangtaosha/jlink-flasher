JLink Flasher
=============

[SEGGER J-Links](http://segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html) are the most widely used line of debug probes available today. Any of this J-Link 
debug probe can be also used as flash programmer,  what can save you a lot of time and money in 
developing a new product. For this purpose exist Windows application [J-Flash](http://segger.com/jflash.html) developed by SEGGER, 
which can program internal and external flash on ARM/Cortex devices.  Because I didn't found any 
similar tool for Linux, thus I have decided to create something useful by myself. And here is my first 
version of J-Link programmer GUI based on wxPython.
